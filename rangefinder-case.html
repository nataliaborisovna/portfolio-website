      <h3>3. Research</h3>
      <h4>High-Level Interview with Principal Engineer:</h4>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To grasp the basic principles of the mathematical algorithm behind the technology.</p>
      <p><strong>Process:</strong> Set a clear goal to understand the technology at a high level. I asked the Principal Engineer to explain the algorithm's foundational concepts and logic. Summarized and documented the main principles discussed. The main aim was to gain a high-level understanding of the technology's mathematical basis from the Principal Engineer.</p>
      
      <h4>Competitor Analysis:</h4>
      <p><strong>Method:</strong> Reviewed existing range finder apps and laser-based tools on the market.</p>
      <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>There is no app, aiming to use the same technology. Because the product will be unique, there might be UX/UI solutions never used before.</li>
        <li>Most apps lacked intuitive interfaces, making it difficult for users to understand the process and measurements.</li>
        <li>Few competitors incorporated augmented reality, which could enhance precision and user trust.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Ximity Labs approach to using a combination of camera, accelerometer, and gyroscope for precise measurements offers advantages over other common methods, including those using LiDAR or relying on photogrammetry. <br>

  1. LiDAR-based Apps: Apple Measure app, Canvas
  While LiDAR sensors provide high precision and depth information, they are generally more effective within a limited range (typically up to 5-10 meters), and can struggle with direct sunlight and measuring far-off objects, as the scattered laser beams may return weak signals.
  By leveraging accelerometer and gyroscope data, Ximity app is not constrained by the same range of limitations and can perform effectively in outdoor environments. This method is less susceptible to issues like varying lighting conditions, which can affect LiDAR accuracy. <br>

  2. Photogrammetry-based Apps: AR Plan 3D, Magicplan
  Photogrammetry Limitations technique relies heavily on visual data from the camera. It can be negatively impacted by poor lighting, shadows, or lack of distinct visual features in the environment.
  Ximity app minimizes these issues by not relying solely on visual data. By integrating precise accelerometer and gyroscope measurements, it can deliver consistent performance regardless of visual conditions. This makes it particularly robust for outdoor use where lighting and shadows vary significantly.
      </p>

      <h4>User Interviews:</h4>
      <p><strong>Method:</strong> Conducted one-on-one interviews and created Affinity Map with experienced users of range-finding devices, measuring tools, and potential users who regularly use range-finding tools. The focus group included army veterans, architects, golfers, hunters, builders, users of other similar apps, and people with little to no experience with such devices.</p>
